\title{Outstanding Employee Tax Liability}
\usage{
outstanding_liability(actual_employeeLiability, payment_made)

outstanding_liability(actual_employeeLiability, payment_made)
}
\arguments{
\item{actual_employeeLiability}{Numeric vector. Represents the actual tax liability of one or more employees.}

\item{payment_made}{Numeric vector. Corresponding payments already made by the employee(s).}
}
\value{

A numeric vector representing the outstanding tax liability after deducting payments.
}
\description{
The \code{outstanding_liability()} function calculates the remaining tax liability
of an employee after considering payments made. It ensures valid numeric inputs,
prevents overpayment, and supports both scalar and vectorized operations.

}
\details{
This function validates that both inputs are numeric and non-negative. Additionally:
\itemize{
\item If any value in \code{payment_made} exceeds \code{actual_employeeLiability}, an error is thrown.
\item The function supports vectorized operations, making it efficient for batch computations.
}
