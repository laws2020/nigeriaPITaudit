\title{Consolidated Relief Allowance (CRA)}
\usage{
consolidated_relief(gross_income, period = "yearly")
}
\arguments{
\item{gross_income}{Numeric. The income on which CRA is computed, typically the result of \code{gross_income()}.}

\item{period}{Character. The period for which CRA is calculated. Accepts \code{"yearly"} (default) or \code{"monthly"}.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the \strong{Consolidated Relief Allowance (CRA)}.
}
\description{
\code{consolidated_relief()} computes the \strong{Consolidated Relief Allowance (CRA)},
a key tax relief under Nigeria’s \strong{Personal Income Tax Act (PITA) 2020}.
}
\details{
The CRA is designed to reduce the taxable income of an individual, ensuring
that a portion of their earnings is exempt from taxation before applying the income tax rates.

According to \strong{Section 33(2) of PITA 2020}, the Consolidated Relief Allowance (CRA) is defined as:

\emph{"There shall be allowed a consolidated relief allowance of ₦200,000 subject to a minimum
of 1\% of gross income, whichever is higher, plus 20\% of the gross income.
The balance shall be taxable in accordance with the income table in the Sixth Schedule to this Act."}

This means the CRA is computed using the formula:

\deqn{
  CRA =
  \begin{cases}
  \text{Gross Income} \times 20\% + 200,000, & \text{if } 1\% \times \text{Gross Income} \leq 200,000 \\
  \text{Gross Income} \times 20\% + 1\% \times \text{Gross Income}, & \text{if } 1\% \times \text{Gross Income} > 200,000
  \end{cases}
}

This logic can also be expressed in \strong{Excel} as:

\code{CRA = IF(gross_income * 1\% > 200000, gross_income * 1\% + gross_income * 20\%, 200000 + gross_income * 20\%)}

In R, this is implemented using the \code{ifelse()} function.
}
\examples{
# Example 1: If 1\% of gross income is greater than 200,000 Naira
consolidated_relief(5000000)
# Returns: (1\% * 5000000) + (20\% * 5000000) = 50,000 + 1,000,000 = 1,050,000

# Example 2: If 1\% of gross income is less than or equal to 200,000 Naira
consolidated_relief(2000000)
# Returns: 200,000 + (20\% * 2000000) = 200,000 + 400,000 = 600,000

# Example 3: Compute monthly CRA for a gross income of 3,600,000 Naira
consolidated_relief(3600000, "monthly")
# 1\% of 3,600,000 = 36,000 (greater than 16,666.67, so we take 36,000)
# Monthly CRA = (36,000 + 20\% * 3,600,000) = 36,000 + 720,000 = 756,000
