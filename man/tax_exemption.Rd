\usage{
tax_exemption(gross_salary, rate)
}
\arguments{
\item{gross_salary}{Numeric. The total gross earnings before deductions.}

\item{rate}{Numeric or character. The deduction rate, which can be:
\itemize{
\item A decimal proportion (e.g., 0.08 for 8\%).
\item A whole number percentage (e.g., 8 for 8\%).
\item A percentage string (e.g., "8\%").
}
If given as a percentage (whole number or string), it is converted to a proportion.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the total tax-exempt deduction.
}
\description{
\code{tax_exemption()} calculates tax-exempt deductions based on a specified rate and gross salary.
This function serves as a foundation for various statutory deductions such as pension, NHF, and NHIS.
}
\details{
The \code{tax_exemption()} function determines the amount that qualifies for tax exemption
by applying a specified deduction rate to the gross salary (total earnings before deductions).
The function allows flexibility in how the deduction rate is provided.

Accepted formats for \code{rate}:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Proportion (Decimal Form)}: e.g., 0.08 for 8\%.
\item \strong{Whole Number Percentage}: e.g., 8 for 8\%.
\item \strong{Percentage String}: e.g., "8\%" for 8\%.
}

If the rate is given as a whole number or percentage string (e.g., "8\%"),
the function converts it to a decimal proportion by dividing by 100.

This function is designed to be reused in other deduction calculations such as:
\code{\link{pension_deduction}}, \code{\link{nhf_deduction}}, and \code{\link{nhis_deduction}}.
}
\examples{
# Using a proportion (8\% as 0.08)
tax_exemption(2000000, 0.08)   # Returns 160000

# Using a whole number percentage (8\%)
tax_exemption(2000000, 8)      # Also returns 160000

# Using a percentage string ("8\%")
tax_exemption(2000000, "8\%")   # Also returns 160000

# Using a different percentage (12\%)
tax_exemption(2000000, "12\%")  # Returns 240000
