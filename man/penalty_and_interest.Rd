A list containing:
\describe{

\item{Days_Overdue}{Number of days past the due date.}
\item{Interest_Amount}{Calculated interest on overdue amount (rounded to 2 decimal places).}
\item{Penalty_Amount}{Penalty based on employer type (NGN 50,000 or NGN 500,000).}

\description{
The \code{penalty_and_interest()} function computes the penalty and interest applicable to late remittance of Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) taxes,
in accordance with the Personal Income Tax Act (PITA) and the Finance Act 2020 of Nigeria.
Employers are required to remit deducted PAYE taxes on or before the 10th day of the month following the month of deduction.
Failure to remit within this timeline attracts a penalty and interest as specified in the law.
}
\details{
The Finance Act 2020, amending relevant sections of PITA, specifies that:
\itemize{
\item Interest shall accrue at the prevailing Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) minimum rediscount rate (currently approximated at 21\%) on a daily basis until payment is made.
}

The function performs the following operations:
\itemize{
\item Converts \code{due_date} and \code{payment_date} to Date objects.
\item If \code{payment_date} is on or before \code{due_date}, it returns a message indicating no penalty or interest applies.
\item Otherwise, calculates the number of days overdue.
\item Uses a daily interest rate derived from an annual rate of 21\% (0.21 / 365).
\item Computes the interest accrued on the unpaid tax for the number of days overdue.
\item Calculates the total liability as the sum of the original tax, interest, and penalty.
}
