\title{Penalty and Interest for Late Tax Payment}
\usage{
penalty_and_interest(
  unpaid_tax,
  due_date,
  payment_date,
  employer_type = "corporate"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{unpaid_tax}{Numeric. The outstanding tax amount that has not been remitted.}

\item{due_date}{Character or Date. The due date for the tax payment. It must be in a format convertible by \code{as.Date()}.}

\item{payment_date}{Character or Date. The actual date on which the tax payment was made. It must be convertible to a Date.}

\item{employer_type}{Character. Specifies the type of employer, either "individual" or "corporate" (default is "corporate").
This determines the fixed penalty amount applied.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\describe{
\item{Unpaid_Tax}{The original unpaid tax amount.}
\item{Days_Overdue}{The number of days by which the payment is late.}
\item{Interest_Amount}{The computed interest on the unpaid tax over the overdue period (rounded to 2 decimal places).}
\item{Penalty_Amount}{The fixed penalty amount based on the employer type.}
\item{Total_Liability}{The sum of the unpaid tax, interest, and penalty, representing the total tax liability (rounded to 2 decimal places).}
}
}
\description{
This \code{penalty_and_interest()} function calculates the penalty and interest charged on an unpaid tax amount when the tax payment is made after the due date.
Under Nigerian tax regulations, if a payment is late, a fixed penalty is applied based on the employer type (individual or corporate),
and interest accrues on the unpaid tax at a specified annual rate. The total liability is the sum of the original unpaid tax, the interest
accrued over the period of delay, and the fixed penalty.
}
\details{
The function works as follows:
\itemize{
\item Both \code{due_date} and \code{payment_date} are converted to Date objects.
\item If \code{payment_date} is on or before \code{due_date}, the function returns a message indicating that no penalty or interest applies.
\item Otherwise, it computes the number of days overdue.
\item An annual interest rate of 21\% (0.21) is used, which is converted to a daily rate by dividing by 365.
\item The interest amount is calculated by multiplying the unpaid tax by the daily interest rate and the number of days overdue.
\item A fixed penalty is applied: 50,000 NGN for individuals and 500,000 NGN for corporate employers.
\item The total liability is then calculated by summing the unpaid tax, the interest amount, and the penalty.
}

# Example 1: Payment made on time (no penalty or interest)
penalty_and_interest(1000000, "2024-01-31", "2024-01-31", employer_type = "corporate")

# Example 2: Late payment by a corporate employer
penalty_and_interest(1000000, "2024-01-31", "2024-04-01", employer_type = "corporate")

# Example 3: Late payment by an individual employer
penalty_and_interest(1000000, "2024-01-31", "2024-04-01", employer_type = "individual")

}
