\title{Gross Income}
\usage{
gross_income(gross_salary, pension, nhis, nhf)
}
\arguments{
\item{gross_salary}{Numeric. The total earnings computed by \code{gross_salary()}.}

\item{pension}{Numeric. The pension contribution deduction.}

\item{nhis}{Numeric. The NHIS (National Health Insurance Scheme) deduction.}

\item{nhf}{Numeric. The NHF (National Housing Fund) deduction.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the \strong{Gross Income} after tax-exempt deductions.
}
\description{
\code{gross_income()} computes the \strong{Gross Income}, which is derived by subtracting tax-exempt
deductions (such as pension contributions, NHIS, and NHF) from the \strong{Gross Salary}.
}
\details{
The Gross Income serves as the basis for determining \strong{taxable income} before the application of
reliefs and allowances.

The formula for Gross Income is:

\deqn{
  \text{Gross Income} = \text{Gross Salary} - (\text{Pension} + \text{NHIS} + \text{NHF})
}

In R code, this is computed as:
\code{gross_income(gross_salary, pension, nhis, nhf)}

The \strong{Finance Act 2020} redefines \emph{gross income} in \strong{Section 33(2) of the Personal Income Tax Act (PITA)} as:

\emph{"For the purposes of this Section, 'gross income' means income from all sources less all non-taxable income,
income on which no further tax is payable, tax-exempt items listed in paragraph (2) of the Sixth Schedule,
and all allowable business expenses and capital allowances."}

This means that \strong{Gross Income} is now calculated by subtracting:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Non-taxable income}
\item \strong{Tax-exempt items} (such as employee contributions to \strong{pension schemes, NHIS, NHF, and life assurance premiums})
\item \strong{Allowable business expenses and capital allowances}
}

These deductions are applied \strong{before computing the Consolidated Relief Allowance (CRA)}.
