\description{
\code{rent_relief()} Computes the Rent Relief Allowance (RRA) under Nigeria's proposed tax reform 2024.
Taxpayers can deduct either \strong{₦200,000} or \strong{20\% of their annual rent}, whichever is lower,
from their taxable income.
}
\details{
The Nigerian tax reform bill introduces the Rent Relief Allowance (RRA), replacing the
Consolidated Relief Allowance (CRA). The relief is capped at \strong{₦200,000}, ensuring that
taxpayers paying higher rent do not exceed this deduction limit.

The function ensures that only \strong{the lesser value} between 20\% of rent and ₦200,000 is deducted.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item If rent is \strong{below ₦1,000,000}, the deduction is \strong{20\% of rent}.
\item If rent is \strong{₦1,000,000 or more}, the maximum deduction is \strong{₦200,000}.
}
}
\examples{
# Example 1: Rent below ₦1M (20\% is lower)
rent_relief(500000)  # Returns 100000 (20\% of 500K)

# Example 2: Rent above ₦1M (capped at 200K)
rent_relief(2000000) # Returns 200000 (capped)
