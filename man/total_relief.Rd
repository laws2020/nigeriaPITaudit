\description{
\code{total_relief()} computes the \strong{Total Relief}, which is the sum of all tax-exempt
allowances, including the \strong{Consolidated Relief Allowance (CRA)}, pension contributions,
\strong{National Housing Fund (NHF)} deductions, and \strong{National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS)} deductions.
}
\details{
\strong{Legal Basis:}
According to \strong{Section 33(2) of the Personal Income Tax Act (PITA) 2020},
taxpayers are entitled to various reliefs, including:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Consolidated Relief Allowance (CRA)} – Computed as per PITA Section 33(2).
\item \strong{Pension Contributions} – Recognized as a tax-deductible item under the Pension Reform Act.
\item \strong{National Housing Fund (NHF) Contributions} – Exempt under the NHF Act.
\item \strong{National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) Contributions} – Exempt per the NHIS Act.
}

\strong{Computation Formula:}
\deqn{
  \text{Total Relief} = \text{CRA} + \text{Pension} + \text{NHF} + \text{NHIS}
}

The \strong{Total Relief} is deducted from the \strong{Gross Income} to determine the \strong{Taxable Income},
which is then subject to personal income tax rates.

\strong{Excel Equivalent Formula:}
\code{Total_Relief = CRA + Pension + NHF + NHIS}
}

# Example Calculation
total_relief(1500000, 180000, 5750, 11500)  # Returns the sum of all reliefs
