\title{Gross Salary for Employees}
\usage{
gross_salary(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Numeric vectors representing different components of an employee's earnings (e.g., Basic Salary, Allowances, Bonuses).}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the computed gross emolument for each employee.
}
\description{
\code{gross_salary()} calculates the total earnings from employment before applying deductions for tax-exempt items.
It sums up all salary components (e.g., basic salary, allowances, bonuses, etc.) before any deductions are applied.
}
\details{
The function accepts multiple numeric vectors representing different components of an employee's earnings
and returns their row-wise sum. If any non-numeric values are provided, the function throws an error.

The formula for Gross Salary is given by:

\deqn{
  \text{Gross Salary} = \text{Basic Salary} + \text{Housing} + \text{Transport} + \text{Utility} + \text{Meal} + \ldots
}

\emph{"Gross salary" is defined as:}
\emph{"wages, salaries, allowances (including benefits in kind), gratuities,
superannuation, and any other incomes derived solely from employment."}

The \code{gross_salary()} function is fundamental in payroll calculations and serves as a base for computing
deductions, taxable income, and other salary-related computations within the \code{nigeriaPITaudit} package.

It supports missing values (\code{NA}) by ignoring them during computation. If all values in a row are \code{NA}, the function returns \code{0} for that row.
}
\note{
\itemize{
\item All input vectors must be numeric and of the same length (i.e., corresponding to the same number of employees).
\item The function ignores \code{NA} values while summing components.
\item If all values in a row are \code{NA}, the function returns \code{0} for that row.
}
}
\examples{
# Example dataset
df <- data.frame(
  Employee = c("John", "Bassey", "James", "Abigail", "Ruth"),
  BasicSalary = c(120000, 110000, 115000, 90000, 130000),
  RiskAllowance = c(100000, 120000, 13400, 150000, 189999),
  Bonus = c(5000, NA, 7000, 3000, 10000)
)

# Compute Gross Salary
df$GrossSalary <- gross_salary(df$BasicSalary, df$RiskAllowance, df$Bonus)

# View the updated dataset
print(df)

# Example 1: Sum of basic salary and two allowances
gross_salary(500000, 200000, 100000)  # Returns 800000

# Example 2: Handling NA values (they are ignored)
gross_salary(3000000, NA, 500000)  # Returns 3500000
