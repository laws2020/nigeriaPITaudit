#' Employee Tax Liability (PITA 2020)
#'
#' The \code{employee_tax_liability()} function computes the **Personal Income Tax (PAYE)** liability for an individual
#' based on Nigeriaâ€™s **Personal Income Tax Act (PITA) 2020** graduated tax brackets. For
#' more details, refer to the **Finance Act 2020** document.
#'
#' @details
#' The tax calculation follows Nigeria's progressive tax system:
#' \enumerate{
#'   \item Income below 300,000 NGN is taxed at **1%**.
#'   \item The first 300,000 NGN is taxed at **7%**.
#'   \item The next 300,000 NGN is taxed at **11%**.
#'   \item The next 500,000 NGN is taxed at **15%**.
#'   \item The next 500,000 NGN is taxed at **19%**.
#'   \item The next 1,600,000 NGN is taxed at **21%**.
#'   \item Any income above 3,200,000 NGN is taxed at **24%**.
#' }
#'
#' **Note:** According to the **Finance Act 2020**, employees earning minimum wage
#' are **exempt** from PAYE tax.
#'
#' @param taxable_income Numeric. The taxable income after applying all allowable deductions.
#' @param period Character. Specifies whether the tax is calculated on a **yearly** or **monthly** basis.
#'               Default is **"yearly"**.
#'
#' @return A numeric value representing the total PAYE tax liability.
#'
#' @examples
#' # Example: Employee with a taxable income of 4,500,000 NGN (Yearly)
#' employee_tax_liability(4500000)

#' # Example: Employee with a taxable income of 375,000 NGN (Monthly)
