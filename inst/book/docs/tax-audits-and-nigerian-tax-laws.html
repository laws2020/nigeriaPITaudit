<p>This chapter provides an overview of tax audits, focusing on the types of audits conducted within the Nigerian tax system. It introduces the key elements of risk management in tax audits and examines the core tax laws that govern Nigeria’s taxation, including the Personal Income Tax Act (PITA), the Finance Act 2020, and the Business Facilitation and Miscellaneous Act 2023. Additionally, this chapter explores the statutory deductions required under Nigerian law and discusses the various exemptions and allowable business expenses that affect the computation of taxes.</p>
<p><strong>1.1 Overview of Tax Audit Types</strong></p>
<p>Tax audits are essential processes in the enforcement of tax compliance and the identification of discrepancies in tax payments. The Nigerian tax authorities, particularly the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), conduct different types of audits to ensure proper remittance of taxes. These audits include:</p>
<p><strong>Desk Audits:</strong> Desk audits are conducted remotely, typically through the review of tax filings, documents, and other relevant records submitted by taxpayers. These audits primarily focus on reviewing submitted returns to verify accuracy and ensure compliance with the tax laws.</p>
<p><strong>Field Audits:</strong> Field audits involve a more hands-on approach, where tax auditors visit the taxpayer’s business premises to examine financial records, accounting systems, and other documents. This audit type provides a more in-depth assessment and allows auditors to interact with the business’s operations and staff.</p>
<p><strong>Forensic Audits:</strong> Forensic audits are specialized audits aimed at detecting fraud, financial mismanagement, or irregularities. These audits involve investigating complex financial transactions and systems to uncover any fraudulent activities or non-compliance with tax laws.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 Risk Management in Tax Audits</strong></p>
<p>Risk management is a critical component in the tax audit process. In Nigeria, one of the most challenging areas of tax compliance is the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system, which requires employers to deduct and remit taxes on behalf of their employees. Understanding the risks associated with PAYE and payroll compliance is essential for tax auditors, as errors or non-compliance can result in significant financial penalties for organizations.</p>
<p>Effective risk management involves identifying and addressing areas where non-compliance is most likely. Common challenges include incorrect tax computations, failure to remit deductions promptly, and misinterpretation of tax laws. Regular internal audits and staying updated with legislative changes are crucial strategies to mitigate these risks.</p>
<p><strong>Key risks in PAYE compliance include:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Incorrect tax computation:</strong> Errors in calculating taxes owed can lead to underpayment or overpayment of taxes.</p>
<p><strong>Failure to remit taxes:</strong> Employers may fail to remit deducted taxes to the relevant authorities on time.</p>
<p><strong>Incorrect categorization of employees:</strong> Misclassifying employees can lead to incorrect tax rates or exemptions.</p>
<p>Tax auditors must ensure that organizations follow the proper procedures for computing and remitting PAYE and ensure compliance with tax regulations.</p>
<p><strong>1.3 Introduction to Nigerian Tax Laws</strong></p>
<p>The Nigerian tax system is governed by various statutes and regulations that outline how taxes should be levied, collected, and remitted. Some of the most important laws governing taxation in Nigeria include:</p>
<p><em><strong>Personal Income Tax Act (PITA): PITA is the primary legislation governing personal income tax in Nigeria. It specifies the tax rates and methods for computing taxes owed by individuals and businesses, including the tax treatment of different income types and exemptions.</strong></em></p>
<p>Section 33(2) defines “gross income” for the purpose of computing the Consolidated Relief Allowance (CRA) as:</p>
<p><em>“Income from all sources less all non-taxable income, income on which no further tax is payable, tax-exempt items listed in paragraph (2) of the Sixth Schedule, and all allowable business expenses and capital allowances.”</em></p>
<p><em>Finance Act 2020:</em> The Finance Act 2020 is a significant piece of legislation that provides important amendments to the Personal Income Tax Act and other tax laws. It introduces changes in tax rates, exemptions, and allowable expenses that taxpayers can use to reduce their tax liability. This Act introduced amendments to various tax laws, <em><strong>including the redefinition of “gross income”</strong></em> in Section 33(2) of PITA, impacting the calculation of the CRA</p>
<p><strong>Business Facilitation and Miscellaneous Act 2023:</strong> This Act includes provisions aimed at enhancing the ease of doing business in Nigeria. Section 4 of the National Housing Fund (NHF) Act was revised to state that while public sector employees and self-employed individuals earning the national minimum wage and above are required to contribute 2.5% of their monthly income to the NHF, private sector employees may choose to contribute voluntarily.</p>
<p><strong>1.4 Overview of Statutory Deductions</strong></p>
<p>Tax compliance in Nigeria involves adhering to various regulations that require the deduction and remittance of specific contributions from employees’ salaries and wages. These statutory deductions are categorized into two main groups:</p>
<p><strong>1.4.1 Statutory Deductions from Employees’ Earnings</strong></p>
<p>These deductions are made directly from employees’ salaries and are intended to contribute to national development and social welfare programs. They include:</p>
<p><strong>Pension Contributions:</strong></p>
<p>As stipulated in the Pension Reform Act 2014, <strong>employers are required to contribute a minimum of 10% of an employee’s monthly emoluments, while employees contribute a minimum of 8%.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 20(1g) of the PITA has been amended to specifically limit tax relief for pension contributions only to schemes, provident or retirement benefits funds that are recognised under the Pension Reform Act (PRA) 2014.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong></p>
<p>Any pension contribution made into a scheme not recognised under the PRA 2014 will not qualify for tax deduction. Individuals who contribute to foreign schemes will not be able to claim a deduction in Nigeria for such contributions. Employers should ensure that only contributions to approved pension schemes under the PRA are treated as an allowable deduction on payroll.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>
<p><em>Monthly Emoluments (Section 102 of the Act): <strong>“Monthly emoluments” means total emoluments as may be defined in the employee’s contract of employment, but shall not be less than:</strong></em></p>
<p>• Basic Salary</p>
<p>• Housing Allowance</p>
<p>• Transport Allowance</p>
<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong></p>
<p>So, by default and legal minimum, the pension contribution is calculated from:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
pension = \frac{8}{\100}*gross salary
\]</span></p>
<p>The law uses the phrase “shall not be less than”, which means these three components are the legal floor, not the limit.</p>
<p>Can Other Benefits Be Included?</p>
<p>Yes — if the employment contract or company policy specifies it, the following may also be added to “monthly emoluments.”</p>
<p><strong>National Housing Fund (NHF):</strong></p>
<p>Following the amendments by the Business Facilitation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2023, public sector employees and self-employed individuals earning at least the national minimum wage are mandated to contribute 2.5% of their monthly income to the NHF. Private sector employees may opt to contribute voluntarily.</p>
<p><strong>National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS):</strong></p>
<p>Under the NHIS, contributions are typically set at 15% of an employee’s basic salary, with the employer contributing 10% and the employee contributing 5%. This scheme aims to provide accessible and affordable healthcare to employees and their dependents.</p>
<p><strong>Life assurance as an allowable deduction</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 33(3) reinstates the relief by way of deduction for the premium paid by an individual to an insurance company in respect of insurance for his life or that of his spouse or contract of deferred annuity for his own life or that of his spouse in the preceding year of assessment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong> This provision was previously removed by the Finance Act 2019, perhaps in error, but has now been reinstated.</p>
<p>Individuals can now continue to claim tax reliefs on premium payments on their life assurance or that of their spouse.</p>
<p><strong>Tax exemption for minimum wage earners</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 37 and para 33 of the Third Schedule of the PITA</strong> have been amended to exempt from personal income tax any persons earning the national minimum wage or less from any employment. Section 108 defines this as the extant national Minimum Wage pursuant to National Minimum Wage Act.</p>
<p><strong>Implications:</strong> Employees who earn no more than the National Minimum Wage (currently NGN30,000) are no longer liable to tax or deduction of monthly Pay As You Earn (PAYE).</p>
<p><strong>1.4.2 Statutory Deductions from Employers</strong></p>
<p>These deductions are borne by the employer as part of their overall cost to the company (CTC). Employers are required by law to remit these amounts to the relevant authorities. They include:</p>
<p>• Industrial Training Fund (ITF): Employers with at least five employees or an annual turnover of N50 million and above are required to contribute 1% of their annual payroll to the ITF, as mandated by the Industrial Training Fund Act.
This contribution is due by the 31st of March of the subsequent year.</p>
<p>• Employee Compensation Scheme (NSITF): Employers must contribute 1% of the annual gross pay to the Nigerian Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF), along with an additional 1% of the Basic Health Trust (BHT) for NECA members.</p>
<p>• National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS): Employers with at least 10 employees must contribute 10% of the employee’s monthly basic salary to the NHIS.</p>
<p>• Group Life Assurance: Employers are required to take out a group life insurance policy to benefit the dependents of their employees in the event of death. This policy was introduced under the PENCOM Act 2014.</p>
<p><strong>1.5 Tax Exemptions and Allowable Business Expenses</strong></p>
<p>Tax exemptions and allowable business expenses play a significant role in reducing the tax liabilities of both individuals and organizations. Under Nigerian tax law, certain items are exempt from tax, and there are expenses that can be deducted to reduce the taxable income.</p>
<p><strong>1.5.1 Tax Exemptions</strong></p>
<p>• Tax-Exempt Items: Contributions to pension funds, NHF, NHIS, and life assurance premiums are considered tax-exempt. These are deducted from gross income before calculating the Consolidated Relief Allowance (CRA), as outlined in Section 33(2) of PITA.</p>
<p><strong>1.5.2 Allowable Business Expenses</strong></p>
<p>• Allowable Business Expenses: Expenses that are wholly, exclusively, necessarily, and reasonably incurred in the production of income are deductible for tax purposes. This includes costs such as salaries, rent, utilities, and other operational expenses essential to running the business.</p>
<p><strong>1.6 Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, understanding the various types of tax audits and the statutory deductions required by Nigerian tax law is crucial for ensuring compliance and avoiding penalties. Tax auditors must be well-versed in the Personal Income Tax Act (PITA), the Finance Act 2020, and the Business Facilitation and Miscellaneous
Act 2023 to effectively carry out audits and verify that taxes have been correctly computed and remitted. Understanding exemptions and allowable business expenses further enables accurate tax reporting and ensures organizations comply with tax regulations.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will delve into the practical application of these concepts, including how to compute statutory deductions using tools like the nigeriaPITaudit R package for tax audits.</p>
<p><strong>3 Gross Income </strong></p>
<p>Gross Income Section 33(2) of the PITA has been amended as follows: “For the purposes of this Section, “gross income” means income from all sources less all non-taxable income, income on which no further tax is payable, tax-exempt items listed in paragraph (2) of the sixth schedule and all allowable business expenses and capital allowances”</p>
<p><strong>3.1 Interpretation:</strong></p>
<p>This provision refined the legal definition of gross income and explicitly states that gross income is no longer interpreted as the total income earned from all sources in its entirety. Instead, it is now defined net of certain exclusions and deductions, thereby narrowing the tax base to reflect only effectively taxable income. Specifically, the revised definition stipulates that gross income comprises income from all sources, after deducting exempted items such as pension, nhf, nhis, life assurance, etc</p>
<p>As a result, employees will no longer benefit from the additional 20% relief previously claimable on the portion of their income that relates to National Housing Fund, pension contribution and other tax-exempt items. The reduction in CRA would result in higher effective tax rate and lower disposable income. Employers need to update their payroll templates or applications to ensure compliance.</p>
<p><strong>4 Consolidated Relief Allowance (CRA) and Gross Income</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.1 Gross Income under the Finance Act 2020</strong></p>
<p>According to Section 33(1) of the Personal Income Tax Act (PITA), as amended by the Finance Act 2020, “there shall be allowed a Consolidated Relief Allowance (CRA) of N200,000 or 1% of gross income, whichever is higher, plus 20% of gross income.”</p>
<p>Gross income, in this context, refers to the total earnings of a taxpayer from all employment sources before any deductions, including:</p>
<p>• Basic salary</p>
<p>• Allowances (e.g., housing, transport, medical)</p>
<p>• Bonuses and overtime</p>
<p>• Non-monetary benefits (where applicable)</p>
<p>The Finance Act 2020 harmonizes definitions and clearly outlines gross income to exclude tax-exempt items or income not derived from employment (like dividends or capital gains). This standardization is crucial in determining the actual amount eligible for CRA.</p>
<p>Interpretation: Gross income is the basis for calculating the Consolidated Relief Allowance (CRA); the higher of NGN200,000 or 1% of Gross Income plus 20% of Gross Income. The new definition means that tax exempt items should now be deducted from gross emolument before computing the CRA.</p>
<p><strong>4.2 Non-Taxable Income and Its Impact on CRA</strong></p>
<p>While computing CRA, certain categories of income are exempt from tax under the Third Schedule to PITA. These include:</p>
<p>• Reimbursable expenses (e.g., duty tour allowance)</p>
<p>• Gratuities</p>
<p>• Contributions to pension, NHF, NHIS, and life assurance</p>
<p>• Leave grants</p>
<p>• Non-taxable benefits-in-kind (as defined)</p>
<p>These exempt incomes are excluded from gross income for the purpose of computing CRA. Including them would result in an inflated CRA, thereby reducing the actual taxable income, which is not in line with statutory requirements.</p>
<p><strong>4.3 Calculation of CRA: Examples and Excel Formula</strong></p>
<p>The CRA is computed using the formula provided in Section 33(1) of PITA:
CRA=max⁡(N200,000,1% of gross income)+20% of gross income = (N200,000, 1% ) + 20% </p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p>Assume an employee has a gross income of ₦3,000,000 annually.</p>
<p>• 1% of ₦3,000,000 = ₦30,000</p>
<p>• 20% of ₦3,000,000 = ₦600,000</p>
<p>• Since ₦200,000 &gt; ₦30,000, we use ₦200,000</p>
<p>CRA = ₦200,000 + ₦600,000 = ₦800,000 = ₦200,000 + ₦600,000 = ₦800,000</p>
<p>Excel Formula:</p>
<p>=IF(A1<em>0.01&gt;200000, A1</em>0.01, 200000+A1*0.2)</p>
<p>= MAX(200000, 0.01 * [Gross_Income]) + 0.2 * [Gross_Income]</p>
<p>This formula can be implemented across rows for multiple employees in an Excel-based payroll system.</p>
<p><strong>4.4 Explanation of Section 33(2) PITA and CRA’s Effect on Taxable Income</strong></p>
<p>Section 33(2) of the PITA provides that CRA shall be deducted from gross income, along with other allowable deductions such as:</p>
<p>• Pension contributions (Section 20(1)(g))</p>
<p>• NHF contributions (NHF Act, 1992)</p>
<p>• NHIS contributions (NHIS Act, 1999)</p>
<p>The resulting figure is the Taxable Income, which is subject to the graduated tax rates under Section 37 of PITA.</p>
<p>Taxable Income = Gross Income − (CRA+Pension+NHF+NHIS) = - ( + + + )</p>
<p>This structured relief ensures that low to middle-income earners are protected from excessive tax burdens and promotes equity in personal taxation.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The Consolidated Relief Allowance (CRA) is a statutory relief that simplifies the Nigerian PAYE system by replacing multiple reliefs with a unified formula.</p>
<p>Correct computation of CRA—anchored on a proper understanding of gross income and tax exemptions—is essential for tax compliance. By adhering to Sections 33(1) and (2) of PITA, both employers and tax auditors can ensure fair and accurate tax liabilities are calculated and remitted.</p>
