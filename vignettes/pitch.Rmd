### Pitch for `nigeriaPITaudit`
### About nigeriaPITaudit
  
`nigeriaPITaudit` is an open-source R package prototype designed to modernize Nigeria’s **Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE)** tax compliance framework. It enables **automated, data-driven payroll audits** through reproducible workflows. 

This package empowers **tax auditors**, **government agencies**, and **civic tech communities** with **transparent, scriptable tools** to improve audit accuracy and taxpayer compliance.

## The Problem
  
Nigeria’s PAYE tax system faces several challenges:
  
- Manual, fragmented reporting processes  

- Inefficient audit capabilities leading to errors and delays  

- Revenue leakages and frequent disputes between employers and tax authorities  
- High compliance costs and significant inconvenience for taxpayers  

These issues undermine public trust, weaken government accountability, and hinder revenue collection.

## Our Solution
  
`nigeriaPITaudit` provides:
  
- **TRACS**: An R-based audit scripting framework for automated, transparent payroll reviews  

- **TRACSweb** (vision): An intuitive collaborative web interface for tax authorities to easily conduct audits and share results  

- **Digital infrastructure** to drastically reduce employers’ compliance burdens and streamline reporting  

- Tools designed to **foster trust**, promote **audit transparency**, and enable **automation**

## Impact and Funding Request
  
Scaling `nigeriaPITaudit` into a full platform will:
  
- Improve efficiency, accuracy, and accountability in Nigeria’s PAYE tax system  

- Lower compliance costs and improve convenience for taxpayers  

- Generate jobs for **developers**, **data analysts**, and **tax experts**  
- Strengthen **fiscal governance** through innovative technology

We seek an initial funding of **₦15,000,000** to develop, pilot, and onboard government and private users. This effort will be supported by the **global R user community** and mentorship from key institutional partners.
